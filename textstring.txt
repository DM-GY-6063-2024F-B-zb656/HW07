She thrust her mind back to Alice. In the gray wall opposite there was a nail hole. Alice would be in there. And she would put her arm around Cathy’s waist, and Cathy would put her arm around Alice’s waist, and they would walk away — best friends — and tiny as the head of a pin. A warm numbness began to creep into her arms and legs. The pain was going from her hands. Her eyelids felt heavy — very heavy. She yawned. She thought or said or thought, “Alice doesn’t know. I’m going right on past.” Her eyes closed and a dizzy nausea shook her. She opened her eyes and stared about in terror. The gray room darkened and the cone of light flowed and rippled like water. And then her eyes closed again and her fingers curled as though they held small breasts. And her heart beat solemnly and her breathing slowed as she grew smaller and smaller and then disappeared — and she had never been.
